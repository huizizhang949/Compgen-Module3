Description 
------------

The first homework of the course is first to make sure you have a running compute environment. 

See [Compute Environment](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/compgen_course_2025_module3/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#compute-environment). 

Once you have a running environment, please download the following notebook and run it. 

```
# Download
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIMSBbioinfo/compgen_course_2025_module3/refs/heads/main/homeworks/hw1/day1_hw_brca_subtypes.ipynb
```

Read the contents and make notes of things that are new to you. Try to make sense of what is going on in the analysis. 

For questions, please use the [github discussions](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/compgen_course_2025_module3/discussions).
